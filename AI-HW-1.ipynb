We'd like to create a list and set of **n** unique integers each (as above), that takes a certain amount of time to produce.  In other words, suppose we chose a time of 0.5 seconds: now how large should **n** be such that it takes about 0.5 seconds for _RandListSet(n)_ to run?  This, of course, is dependent upon many things: principally, the speed of your computer, but also the version of Python you're using, the particular algorithm inside _RandListSet()_, your shoe size, etc. Therefore, you can't just try _TimeIt(n)_ over and over, by hand, until you're in the ballpark of the chosen execution time.\n","\n","OK, so now let's try our hands (actually, _your_ hands) at a small but non-trivial algorithm...\n","\n","Create the function _FindN(TargetTime,Accuracy)_ that will **algorithmically** find the right value of **n** so that it takes approximately _TargetTime_ seconds for _RandListSet(n)_ to run.  The _Accuracy_ parameter deals with the approximation -- it indicates what fraction of _TargetTime_ you are allowed to be different (that was badly explained).  Here's an example: _FindN(2.0,0.1)_ means finding **n** so that _RandListSet(n)_ takes about 2 seconds plus-or-minus 10% -- in other words, between 1.8 and 2.2 seconds.\n","\n","Assume that _TargetTime_ will be somewhere in the range: 0.1 to 1.5 seconds, and _Accuracy_ in the range 0.05 and 0.2.
